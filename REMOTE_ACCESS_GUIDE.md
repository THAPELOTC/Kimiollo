# 🌍 REMOTE ACCESS SETUP - Your System is Live!

## Current Status
✅ Flask Backend: Starting on port 5000  
✅ React Frontend: Starting on port 3000  
🔄 ngrok Tunnels: Starting up for internet access

## How to Get Your Remote Access URLs

### Method 1: Check ngrok Web Interface
1. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:4040`
2. **Look for the "Forwarding" section** - you'll see URLs like:
   - `https://abc123-456.ngrok-free.app` (This is your **FRONTEND** - share this!)
   - `https://def789-012.ngrok-free.app` (This is your **BACKEND**)

### Method 2: Run This Command
Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels" | ConvertTo-Json
```

## 🔗 SHARING YOUR SYSTEM

### For Remote Users:
**Share this URL**: The HTTPS URL from ngrok (e.g., `https://abc123-456.ngrok-free.app`)

### What They Can Do:
- ✅ **Register new accounts**
- ✅ **Login with credentials**
- ✅ **Generate AI business plans**
- ✅ **Upload and analyze documents**
- ✅ **Get funding recommendations**
- ✅ **Download PDF proposals**

## 🛠️ If URLs Don't Show Up Yet:

1. **Wait 30 seconds** - ngrok takes time to establish tunnels
2. **Check the ngrok windows** - look for the URLs in the terminal windows that opened
3. **Try accessing** `http://localhost:4040` to see tunnel status

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES:

### Free ngrok URLs:
- **Change every restart** - get new URLs when you restart ngrok
- **For permanent URLs** - consider upgrading to paid ngrok plan

### Security:
- **CORS is configured** for ngrok domains ✅
- **Your system is ready** for remote access ✅

## 📱 Testing Remote Access:

1. **Get your ngrok URL** from `http://localhost:4040`
2. **Share it with a friend** or test on your phone using mobile data
3. **They should be able to** register, login, and use all features
